### Abstract
In 2021, Indonesia had 19.5 million cases of diabetes and is predicted to increase to 28.6 million
in 2045. One of the biggest causes of diabetes is obesity. Obesity can happen because people
live unhealthy lifestyles and lack exercise. We do an observation in the neighborhood around
one month and also ask some friends. We found out that people are struggling with their diet
and body exercise because of their knowledge. They don’t know how to track their calorie
intake, and also don’t know how to do a proper workout. Those 2 things are important to have a
healthy lifestyle because they can prevent various deadly diseases. So we offer a solution by
creating an application that can inform users about nutrition in food ingredients and workout
information. The application will have 2 main functions right now. The first one is to show the
nutritional information on the scanned food, and also to show the description and some
information about workout movement that the user scans. We want to tackle this problem
because we want to help people avoid obesity. But it is undeniable that in the possible days
there will be a business side for application development.

Based on our team member experience and also some people who are struggling with diet
program. We are excited to tackle this problem because this problem looks easy to solve but it
is not. At the first meeting we discussed the problem that we wanted to solve. We found some
good ideas but that idea is not really impactful for some people. So we choose to come up
with this project to help people who want to change their unhealthy lifestyle to be a good one.
