The following 3 packages are:\n","\n","1. Simulation Package A: consists of 5 machine learning problems. \n","2. Simulation Package B: consists of 5 machine learning problems. The datasets used in Simulation B are different from the dataset in Simulation A.\n","3. Simulation Package C: consists of 5 machine learning problems. The datasets used in Simulation C are different from the dataset in Simulations A and B.\n","\n","In each simulation, the exam will test you on this set of skills (please refer to the [Candidate Handbook](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf) for the details of each category):\n","1. **Tensorflow developer skills**\n","    \n","    You need to demonstrate that you understand how to develop software programs using TensorFlow and that you can find the information you need to work as an ML practitioner.\n","2. **Building and training neural network models using TensorFlow**\n","\n","    You need to understand the foundational principles of machine learning and deep learning using TensorFlow 2.x.\n","3. **Image Classification**\n","\n","    You need to understand how to build image recognition and object detection models with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow 2.x.\n","4. **Natural language processing (NLP)**\n","\n","    You need to understand how to use neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow.\n","5. **Time Series, sequence, and predictions**\n","\n","    You need to understand how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow.\n","\n","## Simulation Guideline:\n","---\n","\n","- Ensure that your computer meets the system requirement mentioned here.\n","- Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your computer. You must install the Python environment from the official Python packages available at Python.org.\n","- You will take the real TensorFlow Developer Certificate Exam in PyCharm IDE. So we strongly recommend you undertake this Exam Simulation in PyCharm IDE to get you familiar with using PyCharm to train TensorFlow models. For the PyCharm installation guide, refer to this link: Install PyCharm.\n","- To build machine learning models in this exam, you will need some library packages installed in your environment. For the details about the libraries and how to install them, please refer to this document: Setting up your Environment. \n","- Please be aware that the size of the dataset (used in the image classification problems) and the saved model in the .h5 file extension are big. So you need to make sure when you work with the exam, you use the best internet provider in your area with adequate internet service. You may also prepare another internet service provider for backup if needed.\n","- The real TensorFlow Developer Exam is expected to take up to 5 hours. So, you have to finish each package of this Exam Simulation in 5 hours. Please make sure that you turn on your timer once you start doing your exam. It may help you manage your time during the Exam Simulation and feel the atmosphere of taking the actual exam.\n","- You may use whatever learning resources you usually use during your machine learning development work. You may also use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or a cloud-based virtual machine to help you train the machine learning model, but make sure that your final model is run on the PyCharm IDE.\n","- You have to complete the exam on your own. Exams are not group projects, and you must not receive any help from anyone.\n","- Do not share your exam code or talk about exam content with anyone. For example, don't write about the exam content in a blog post, share about the exam in a forum, or push exam code to a public repository such as GitHub. Both simulation course contents and the TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam contents are copyrighted and protected by law. All content is confidential. Failure to abide by the law will result in expulsion from any current and future Dicoding or Google programs.\n","\n","# About the [Tensorflow Developer Certificate Exam](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate)\n","The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam tests a developer's foundational knowledge of integrating machine learning into tools and applications. The certificate program requires an understanding of building TensorFlow models using Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and real-world image data and strategies. TensorFlow Developers who have passed the certificate exam have demonstrated skills needed to perform machine learning and deep learning tasks. Below are the requirements for taking the exam. Requirements are subject to change without prior notice. The latest requirements are available on the [Google Developers Certification website](https://developers.google.com/certification).\n","\n","**Language**\n","\n","The exam tests students in their ability to solve problems by building models using TensorFlow 2.x. The exam is available only in English at this time.\n","\n","**ID verification**\n","\n","You must be able to present government-issued photo identification from a non-embargoed country. (See \"U.S.-embargoed countries,\" below.) For Canada, United States, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, and Switzerland, you may use a driver's license. For all other countries you must provide a current passport.\n","\n","You will scan and upload a photo of your ID using your webcam, or you will upload a copy of your ID that you've previously scanned in JPG, PNG, or BMP format.\n","\n","**U.S.-embargoed countries**\n","\n","You must be able to present approved identification showing residence in a non-embargoed country. Google complies with the United States government's list of embargoed countries. The current embargoed country list includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Crimea.\n","\n","**Study guide**\n","\n","Before you take the exam, make sure you can solve the types of challenges that the exam contains. We highly recommend that you have finished and graduated from the below courses:\n","\n","1. [Belajar Dasar Visualisasi Data](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/177)\n","2.
